## Task
**Given a web page with an analog clock created with CSS, write the JavaScript necessary to make the clock functional. Make alterations to the CSS as necessary.**

## Guide
**Steps:**
### 1. Initialize pointer positions and rotation along the x-axis in CSS

```
transform-origin: 100%;
transform: rotate(90deg);
transition: all 0.05s;
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);
```
- **CSS**:
    1.  Set the `transform-origin` CSS property of the `.hand` class to `100%`; 
               
    1. The hands are all laying flat; we need them to be vertical. Rotate all of the
        hands by 90 degrees so that they are upright by giving the `.hand` class a
        `transform` rule with the value `rotate(90deg)`.
    ![demo](../02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock/images/transform.gif)
    1. Set the `transition` CSS property of `.hand` to `all 0.05s`; this tells the browser
        to gradually apply any changes to the element's styling over a 0.05 second period.

    1. Set the `transition-timing-function` CSS property of `.hand` to whatever function
        you prefer, or define your own using the `cubic-bezier()` property value.

- **JavaScript**:

    1. Declare & define variables for each clock hand and reference the corresponding _HTML
        element_.

        EX: `const secondHand = document.querySelector('.second-hand');`

    1. Create a function which will be responsible for calculating the number of degrees that we need
        to rotate each clock hand by. It should accept two arguments: the _current numerical value_ of the
        clock hand, and the max value possible of the clock hand (if you want the number of degrees needed for
        the second hand and the current time is 03:15:18, you would pass in (18, 60) where 18 is the current
        value of the second hand, and 60 is the maximum possible value).

        - Divide the current numerical value of the clock hand by it's max possible value to get the rotation as
        a percentage, then multiply the result of that by 360 (each hand can rotate 360 degrees) to convert
        the value from a percentage to an integer, and increase that result by another 90 degrees to compensate
        for the shift originally applied by the CSS styling on page load.

            ```javascript
            const calcDegrees = (time, max) => ((time / max) * 360) + 90;
            ```

    1. Create a function that will automatically run every second; in the body of the function,
        create a variable and define it as a new Date object. Then, create three variables which will
        hold references to the rotation amount to be applied to each clock hand. To get the rotation amount,
        define the variables as the return value from calling the `calcDegrees` function; each call should
        pass in the correct values in relation to whichever clock hand they are supposed to represent.

    1. Still within the body of the function from step 3, update the `transform` rule for each
        clock hand to their corresponding updated values.

        ```javascript
            /* Steps 3 & 4 */

            // Call function once every second
            setInterval(() => {
            // Create new Date object
            const now = new Date();
            // Get current seconds, minutes, & hours and calculate the degree shift
            const
                secondHandDegrees = calcDegrees(now.getSeconds(), 60),
                minuteHandDegrees = calcDegrees(now.getMinutes(), 60),
                hourHandDegrees = calcDegrees(now.getHours(), 12);
            // Apply rotation to the clock hands corresponding with current time value
            secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondHandDegrees}deg)`;
            minuteHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minuteHandDegrees}deg)`;
            hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hourHandDegrees}deg)`;
            }, 1000); // 1000ms === 1s

        ```

Yaaaaaay! All done!
