## Konami Code
The Konami Code is a sequence of keystrokes that allows players to enable special features in video games made by the Japanese company Konami.
Similarly, we can embed specific code(combination of keys) in our website which when entered through key press trigger some event in our web page.

*Note: Press keys Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A*

There are several websites which hold this hidden code, some of them are:
1. https://kuppiya.com/
2. http://nikdaum.com/
3. https://www.buzzfeed.com/
4. http://terraria.org/
5. http://elliottkember.com/

## Guide
There is pretty much no starter file, this project is a simple JS function. The idea is to trigger an action when a particular key sequence is pressed.
