We will be creating a panel based gallery with flexbox, CSS transitions and javascript. This is CSS heavy and for JS just add and removes classes from dom elements.

---

## HTML

```HTML
<div class="panels">
    <div class="panel panel1">
        <p>Hey</p>
        <p>Let's</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel2">
        ...
    </div>
    ...
</div>
```

The web page content is held in the `div.panels` element and each gallery item is a div.panel element. panel1 to panel5 classes just add the background.

## CSS

We'll use the `panels` class as the _flex container_, and the `panel` class as the _flex items_. By default, _flex items_ are only as wide as they need to be in order to display their contents, but we want them to take up the entire _flex container_. Allow the _flex items_ to take up equal space and fill out the _flex container_ by allowing them to **grow**. Given that we want the content of each _flex item_ to be flexible as well, we're going to display the `panel` class as both a _flex item_ **AND** a _flex container_; this means that elements with the `panel` class will adjust themselves with respect to their _flex container_ (`div` HTML element with class `panels`), and the contents within those elements (in this case, the three `p` HTML elements) will adjust themselves with respect to their own _flex container_ (`div` HTML element with class `panels`).

Horizontally and vertically center the content of the `panel` class, and modify the styling for any _children_ of the `panel` class (`.panel > *`) so that they are displayed as _flex items_ and take up 1/3 of their respective _flex container_. Create new style
definitions for the first and last child elements of the `panel` class to push them off the page and to bring them back in when their parent `panel` is selected, and update the CSS for the `panel open` class so that the selected `div` will be 5x larger than the other `div` elements.

Finally, we'll write some JavaScript code to attach _event listeners_ to each `panel` element that will fire when an panel is clicked on and call their respective _event handlers_; one _event handler_ function will adjust the size of the panel, and the other will be responsible for bringing in the `p` elements that we pushed off earlier.

- CSS

  1. Update the styling applied to the `panels` class to display as a _flex container_:

  ```CSS
  .panels {
    /* ... */
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  2. Update the styling applied to each `panel` so that they equally maximize their width to fill out the _flex container_:

  ```CSS
  .panel {
    /* ... */
    flex: 1;
  }
  ```

  3. Update the styling applied to the `panel` class so that each panel is also a _flex container_ and displays its content in _columns_:

  ```CSS
  .panel {
    /* ... */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  ```

  4. Update the styling applied to the child elements of the `panel` class so they are treated as _flex items_ and are center justified:

  ```CSS
  .panel > * {
    /* ... */
    align-items: center;
    display: flex;
    flex: 1 0 auto;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  ```

  5. Create new style definitions for the _first and last child elements_ of the `panel` class so that the content is pushed off the main page until the panel is selected by the user:

  ```CSS
  .panel > *:first-child {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }

  .panel.open-active > *:first-child {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }

  .panel > *:last-child {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }

  .panel.open-active > *:last-child {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  ```

  6. When the class `open-active` is added to the panel, the `<p>`'s are moved back into view. Also the panel should get bigger when it's opened

  ```CSS
  .panel.open {
    font-size: 40px;
    flex: 5;
  }
  ```

  `font-size` increases from `2em` to `40px` (over 0.7s) and the width increases to 5x of what it was before!

## JavaScript

```JavaScript
  const panels = document.querySelectorAll ('.panel');

  function toggleOpen() {
      this.classList.toggle('open');
  }

  function toggleActive(e) {
      if(e.propertyName.includes('flex')) {
          this.classList.toggle('open-active');
      }
  }

  panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('click',toggleOpen));
  panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('transitionend',toggleActive));
```

1. Declare & define a variable as a reference to _all elements with a class `panels`_.
2. Iterate through the _HTML Node elements_ that the variable is referencing and attach
   an _event listener_ for the `click` event to each element.
3. Repeat step 2, this time attaching an _event listener_ for the `transitionend` event
   and providing a different function name for the _event handler_.
4. Define the function for Step 2 to **toggle** the class `open` on the _function context_.
5. Define the function for Step 3 to **toggle** the class `open-active` on the _function
   context_ **IF** the event which triggered this function has a property name that
   includes the word 'flex'.
   Due to there are different words between browsers, so we use .includes() to find the key word 'flex'.
   - Safari transitionend event.propertyName === flex
   - Chrome + FF transitionend event.propertyName === flex-grow
