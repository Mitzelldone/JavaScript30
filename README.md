### Who is this For?
Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library. Also, you should already know some JavaScript to start - This isn't a JavaScript 101 course.

## About
I created this respitory to keep track of my progress and documentation in the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge and commiting & logging what I have learnt on daily basis.
